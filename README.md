## Project Overview:
This project represents the culmination of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It draws on early concepts such as CSS and JavaScript, intermediate concepts like accessibility and error handling, and advanced concepts such as React and the serviceworker.

This project is a single page app that is a searchable list of pizza places in Seattle, Washington. This app draws on data from Google Maps and Foursquare, using their respective APIs as well as a React structure built from the ground up.

##Dependencies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Installation:
To run the program locally on your computer:
1. Download or clone the repository from github
2. In Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), `cd:` to directory where repository was downloaded
3. Install dependencies `npm install`
4. Start developing `npm start`

### Resources:
Doing this code 'from scratch' was daunting! Udacity was great at giving us the tools throughout the entire Nanodegree experience to teach us step by step to get to this final project and succeed. There are so many people and documentation that helped with this process. I used a lot of the resources listed here https://www.diigo.com/outliner/fkkuvb/Udacity-Neighborhood-Map-Project-(project-%237)?key=25wgqnwals. As well as Stackoverflow, W3Schools and Mozilla websites - plus all the Udacity students on Slack and Facebook.
